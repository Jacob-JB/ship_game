# Ship Modules

The ship is made up of modules arranged in a grid.

Each module has docking ports to interface with other modules.

The layout of modules is a core gameplay element.
Where they are placed relative to each other is important,
some examples include:

- Some modules will only work if they are next to a transformer.
- Access to modules is important, if a module's atmosphere is breached
connected modules can be affected
